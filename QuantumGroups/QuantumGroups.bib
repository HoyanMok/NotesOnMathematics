	abstract = {Since they first arose in the 1970s and early 1980s, quantum groups have proved to be of great interest to mathematicians and theoretical physicists. This book gives a comprehensive view of quantum groups and their applications. The authors build on a self-contained account of the foundations of the subject and go on to treat the more advanced aspects concisely and with detailed references to the literature. Researchers in mathematics and theoretical physics will enjoy this book.},
