	abstract = {Von Neumann algebras were originally designed as a framework for various subjects, a major motivation coming from quantum theory. Although von Nuemann algebras have since turned out to have unexpected connections with many different fields, the contact with quantum physics has remained constant and fruitful. I will try to give an account of a recent interplay between quantum field theory and inclusions of von Nuemann algebras. The latter may arise for example as inclusions of local observable algebras, a structure analyzed earlier [10], [13], [39]–[42] and still productive. Here however I will deal with inclusions associated with superselection sectors [11], a setting related to index theory [36] along a line of research I have been following during about the last six years.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15897},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2309.15897},
	abstract = {It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to the mass of a Schwarzschild-{AdS} black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type {II}, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of "semi-classical" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium ({KMS}) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily {KMS}) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type {II} factor "localized" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type {II}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I\$\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type {II}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another "boundary structure" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type {II}\$\_\{{\textbackslash}infty\}\$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type {II}\$\_\{1\}\$.},

	abstract = {In this book, Robert Wald provides a coherent, pedagogical introduction to the formulation of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. He begins with a treatment of the ordinary one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, progresses through the construction of quantum field theory in flat spacetime to possible constructions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, and, ultimately, to an algebraic formulation of the theory. In his presentation, Wald disentangles essential features of the theory from inessential ones (such as a particle interpretation) and clarifies relationships between various approaches to the formulation of the theory. He also provides a comprehensive, up-to-date account of the Unruh effect, the Hawking effect, and some of its ramifications. In particular, the subject of black hole thermodynamics, which remains an active area of research, is treated in depth.This book will be accessible to students and researchers who have had introductory courses in general relativity and quantum field theory, and will be of interest to scientists in general relativity and related fields.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01958},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2302.01958},
	abstract = {These notes provide an explanation of the type classification of von Neumann algebras, which has made many appearances in recent work on entanglement in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. The goal is to bridge a gap in the literature between resources that are too technical for the non-expert reader, and resources that seek to explain the broad intuition of the theory without giving precise definitions. Reading these notes will provide you with: (i) an argument for why "factors" are the fundamental von Neumann algebras that one needs to study; (ii) an intuitive explanation of the type classification of factors in terms of renormalization schemes that turn unnormalizable positive operators into "effective density matrices;" (iii) a mathematical explanation of the different types of renormalization schemes in terms of the allowed traces on a factor; (iv) an intuitive characterization of type I and {II} factors in terms of their "standard forms;" and (v) a list of some interesting connections between type classification and modular theory, including the argument for why type {III}\$\_1\$ factors are believed to be the relevant ones in quantum field theory. None of the material is new, but the pedagogy is different from other sources I have read; it is most similar in spirit to the recent work on gravity and the crossed product by Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington, and Witten.},
